    //Before we can get started, you must review your project configuration, and enable the required
    //app capabilities for CallKit and VoIP notifications.
    
    //Namely, you must enable "Background modes" capability
    //checking "Audio, AirPlay and Picture in Picture" and "Voice over IP" checkboxes on.
    //You must also enable "Push notifications" capability even if you use VoIP notifications only.
    
    //Privacy usage descriptions:
    //You must add NSCameraUsageDescription and NSMicrophoneUsageDescription to your app Info.plist file.
    //Those values are required to access microphone and camera.
    //In this sample app, those values have been already added for you.
    
    //Consider also to add NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription key into app Info.plist in case you want your users to upload photos on our services.

    //If your build target is less than iOS 11, please add iCloud entitlement with at least Key-value storage checked,
    //otherwise your app is going to crash anytime the user try to upload a document from iCloud.
    //In this sample app, this is already done for you inside 'Signing & Capabilities' tab of project settings.
    
    //To enable build on physical devices, you should disable bitcode on build settings tab of your target settings. In this sample app, this flag is already set for you.
    
    //CallKit:
    //CallKit framework must be linked to your app and it must linked as a required framework,
    //otherwise the app will have a weird behaviour when it is launched upon receiving a VoIP notification.
    //It is going to be launched, but the system is going to suspend it after few milliseconds.
    //In this example app, the CallKit framework has been already added for you.

    //a call from the lock screen or when the app is not in foreground and a call is in progress, the system
    //presents the system call UI to the end user. One of the buttons gives the user the ability to get back into your
    //app. The following statements allows you to change that icon.
    //Beware, the configuration object property expects the image as an NSData object. You must provide a side
    //length 40 points square png image.
